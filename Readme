Project: "Crop mapping using temporal dynamics in California"

**Objectives**
1. Calculate NDVI during a year (2015) for a specific area in California
2. Calculate annual phenology model for different crop fields using RapidEye images

**Data and Tools used**
1. Planet Labs images – Rapid Eye 
  * 5 X 5
  * 16-bit GeoTIFF 
  * Without cloud cover
  * From 01/01/2015 till 25/01/2016
2. Crop fields shapefile (20, manually)
3. Program language: Python, Visualization software: QGIS
4. API Planet Labs (documentation)

**Libraries**
Os
Rasterio
GeoPandas
GDAL
Numpy
Matplotlib
Glob
Geojson

**Structure**
1. We downloaded rapideye images from planet labs  for  our study area( Sacramento, California)
2. Calculate NDVI for selected images (almost one per month)
3. Stack NDVI images (1 band per month – total 9 bands)
4. Create crop fields shapefile (QGIS)
5. Calculate NDVI on each field for a year using Zonal Statistics (we are still working on this)
6. Plot the values of NDVI against time in order to have a phenology model (not finished yet)
7. Identify maximum and minimum values with the corresponding dates and the amplitude of the curves (not finished yet)

**Difilculties**
API and metadata from Planet Labs
Different libraries – arguments - versions
Zonal Statistics – 0 and NoData as stats
Geopanda library is still new
